# Howdy

We'll be chatting about:
- [OpenStax POET](https://github.com/openstax/poet) ([open in gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/openstax/poet))
- [VSCode Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api)
- [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/)

# Warm-up

Before we start, here are a few questions

- What is POET?
- What are VSCode Extensions?
- Is CNXML a Language?

---
## What's a Language Server?

- A process that speaks the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/)
- Can be written in any language as long as it supports a JSON stdio stream or HTTP webserver API
- Upon an initialization request it responds with all the features it implements
- Features include: autocompletion, debuggers, syntax problems, source links, tooltips, ...

---
# Portable?

The Language Server Protocol is not specific to VSCode. You can use POET in other popular editors (Vim/Emacs)


---
## What Our Langauge Server Does

POET uses it in the following ways:

- exposing VSCode language features
- content validation


---
## VSCode Language Features

We listen to updates in CNXML and COLLXML files as well as images and the [/META-INF/books.xml](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/META-INF/books.xml) manifest file.

Our Language Server listens to [the following](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/server.ts)):
- File change events
- Editor updates (before saving occurs)
- Custom "ToC Update" events to update the ToC file

And it provides:
- Auto-completion when creating image links
- Clickable links to other CNXML modules
- Clickable Problem messages when we detect invalid content


---
## Content Validation

_Why not just XML Schema?_
- only validate within a file (no link checking)
- cannot validate a child element based on its ancestors (context sensitive)


---
## Content Validation

We create an in-memory [Model](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/model) of the repo.

Our Language Server checks for:

- Missing images, missing link targets (Page and element in page), duplicate UUIDs, malformed UUID ([source](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/model/page.ts#L166))
- Missing Pages, duplicate chapter titles, duplicate Pages in ToC ([source](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/model/book.ts#L136-L152))
- Missing book COLLXML file ([source](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/model/bundle.ts#L56-L63))
- All orphaned books, pages, & images


---
## Repo Model

The following Objects:

- Bundle (ugh, it should be named "Manifest")
- Book
- Page
- Image


---
## Model Features

Objects have useful getters:

```js
bundle.books[0].toc[0].type
page.links[0].type      // The first link in a page
page.validationErrors() // All validation errors
page.loaded
image.exists       // true if the image exists
```

And **only 1** mutator:

```js
bundle.load(str)
book.load(str)
page.load(str)
image.load(bytes)
```


---
## Missing from the Model

The [server/model/](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/model) directory contains all the parsing & validation logic. Notably, it has the following explicit requirements:

- **NO** async code
- **NO** filesystem read/writes
- **NO** VSCode-specific code
- **NO** null pointers
    - This means a link to a Page that does not exist will link to a Page object (whose `.exists` is false)
- **NO** duplicate objects that represent the same "Book" object
    - This means 2 objects that represent m123 will **always** be `===` to each other


---
## Bonus: Validate before Save

Since the model is filesystem-agnostic adding this feature is [just 3 lines](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/server.ts#L121-L124):

```js
documents.onDidChangeContent(({ document }) => {
  const manager = getBundleForUri(document.uri)
  manager.updateFileContents(document.uri, document.getText())
})
```


---
## Bonus: CLI

Since the model is filesystem-agnostic, a commandline client is just [50 lines of code](https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/model/_cli.ts).

```bash
$ npx ts-node@10.1.0 ./src/model/_cli.ts /path/to/book/repo

# Output:
# =====================
# Validation Errors: 2
# modules/m123/index.cnxml  4:13 Missing Link Target
# collections/test.xml     13:25 Duplicate Chapter Title
```

This can be used for book validation in CI tests or QA.

---
# Validation Errors

The way Validation errors show up in the "Problems" area of VSCode is _two parts_:

- initial startup
- communication between the Language Server, VSCode, and the Extension Client

---
## Validation Errors (cont)
### Initial Startup

1. The extension client starts up
1. The extension client tells VSCode to spawn our Language Server
1. VSCode directly communicates with the Language Server
1. The Langauge Server tells VSCode that it's interested in DocumentChanged Events


---
## Validation Errors (cont)
### Steps
1. The user types a letter on their keyboard
1. VSCode sends the LanguageServer a DocumentChanged event
1. LanguageServer updates the model
1. LanguageServer collects model validation errors and sends Diagnostics events (see [Lang Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#diagnostic))
1. Also, Quarx notices the model updated and sends Notifications to the Client

# More Details

- Async Loading
- Quarx
- Linking the Model to VSCode Language Server

---
# Async Loading

https://github.com/openstax/poet/blob/main/server/src/job-runner.ts

To speed up and give validation errors before the whole book is loaded and because the model is synchronous we have a Job queue that, given a model object, loads it and its dependencies.

There are 2 priorities in the queue: low-priority jobs that load all the books and high-priority jobs that are whichever file is currently open in the editor.

---
## Quarx

Rather than keeping track of which files need to be re-parsed when a file changes (added/edited/removed) and then send Diagnostics events to the extension client, we use a tiny library called [quarx](https://github.com/dmaevsky/quarx).

It's mobx but has the following features: synchronous, 200 lines

---

## Quarx Example

```js
import { autorun, computed, observable, batch } from 'quarx';

const a = observable.box(1);
const b = observable.box(2);
const a_plus_b = computed(() => a.get() + b.get());

console.log('Initial calculation');
autorun(() => console.log(`a + b = ${a_plus_b.get()}`));

console.log('First update');
batch(() => {
  a.set(5);
  b.set(6);
});

console.log('Second update');
batch(() => {
  a.set(4);
  b.set(7);
});
```

Output:

```text
Initial calculation
a + b = 3
First update
a + b = 11
Second update
(nothing. Because the value of a_plus_b did not change)
```

## Model Manager

This provides an interface between the Model and vscode events that come in to the language server.

It can load files, listens to file update events, creates new files, saves files when the model changes...
